# 02_first_hang source code

The source code for the **First Hang** part is in this folder. The article goes through two versions of the hang program, the second version is in the `better-hang` subfolder.

`build.sh` and `clean.sh` can be used to build/clean the program. The lack of a makefile is intentional.
