This part is going to be a detour from bare-metal programming in order to quickly set up a build system using CMake, and briefly show how our program can be debugged while running in QEMU. If you're not interested, you can skip this part, though at least skimming it would be recommended.

# Creating a build system

We will use [CMake](https://cmake.org) as our build manager. CMake provides a powerful language to define projects, and doesn't actually build them itself - CMake generates input for another build system, which will be GNU Make since we're developing on Linux. It's also possible to use Make by itself, but for new projects I prefer to use CMake even when its cross-platform capabilities and other powerful features are not needed.

It should also be noted here that I am far from a CMake expert, and build systems aren't the focus of these articles, so this could certainly be done better.

To begin with, we'll organize our project folder with some subfolders, and create a top-level `CMakeLists.txt`, which is the input file CMake normally expects. The better-organized project structure looks like this:

```
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── scripts
│   └── create-sd.sh
└── src
    ├── cstart.c
    ├── linkscript.ld
    └── startup.s

```

The `src` folder contains all the source code, the `scripts` folder is for utility scripts like the one creating our SD card image, and at the top there's `CMakeLists.txt`.

We want CMake to handle the following for us:

* Rebuild U-Boot if necessary
* Build our program, including the binary converstion with `objcopy`
* Create the SD card image for QEMU
* Provide a way of running QEMU

To accomplish that, `CMakeLists.txt` can contain the following:

```
cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 2.8)

set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Generic)
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR arm)
set(CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING TRUE)

set(UBOOT_PATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../common_uboot")
set(MKIMAGE "${UBOOT_PATH}/tools/mkimage")

set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER "arm-none-eabi-gcc")
set(CMAKE_ASM_COMPILER "arm-none-eabi-as")
set(CMAKE_OBJCOPY "arm-none-eabi-objcopy")

file(GLOB LINKSCRIPT "src/linkscript.ld")
set(ASMFILES src/startup.s)
set(SRCLIST src/cstart.c)

set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} -nostartfiles -nostdlib -g -Wall")
set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "-T ${LINKSCRIPT}")

add_custom_target(u-boot 
            COMMAND make vexpress_ca9x4_config ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi- 
            COMMAND make all ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi- 
            WORKING_DIRECTORY ${UBOOT_PATH})

add_executable(bare-metal ${SRCLIST} ${ASMFILES})
set_target_properties(bare-metal PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME "bare-metal.elf")
add_dependencies(bare-metal u-boot)

add_custom_command(TARGET bare-metal POST_BUILD COMMAND ${CMAKE_OBJCOPY}
    -O binary bare-metal.elf bare-metal.bin COMMENT "Converting ELF to binary")

add_custom_command(TARGET bare-metal POST_BUILD COMMAND ${MKIMAGE}

add_custom_command(TARGET bare-metal POST_BUILD COMMAND bash ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/scripts/create-sd.sh

    COMMENT "Creating SD card image")

                 COMMENT "Running QEMU...")
```

We begin with some preparation, telling CMake that we'll be cross-compiling so it doesn't assume it's building a Linux application, and we store the U-Boot path in a variable. Then there's the specification of the project itself:

```
project (bare-metal-arm C ASM)
```

`bare-metal-arm` is an arbitrary project name, and we indicate that C and assembly files are used in it. The next few lines explicitly specify the cross-compiler toolchain elements to be used. After that, we list the source files included in the project:

```
file(GLOB LINKSCRIPT "src/linkscript.ld")
set(ASMFILES src/startup.s)
set(SRCLIST src/cstart.c)
```

Some people prefer to specify wildcards so that all `.c` files are included automatically, but CMake guidelines recommend against this approach. This is a matter of debate, but here I chose to go with explicitly listed files, meaning that new files will need to manually be added here.

CMake lets us specify flags to be passed to the compiler and linker, which we do:

```
set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} -nostartfiles -nostdlib -g -Wall")
set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "-T ${LINKSCRIPT}")
```

Those are like what we used previously, except for the addition of `-g -Wall`. The `-g` switch enables generation of debug symbols, which we'll need soon, and `-Wall` enables all compiler warnings and is very good to use as a matter of general practice.

We then define a custom target to build U-Boot, which just runs U-Boot's regular make commands. After that we're ready to define our main target, which we say is an executable that should be built out of source files in the `SRCLIST` and `ASMFILES` variables, and should be called `bare-metal.elf`:

```
add_executable(bare-metal ${SRCLIST} ${ASMFILES})
set_target_properties(bare-metal PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME "bare-metal.elf")
```

The two subsequent uses of `add_custom_command` are to invoke `objcopy` and call the `create-sd.sh` script to build the U-Boot uimage.

That's everything we need to build our entire program, all the way to the U-Boot image containing it. It is, however, also convenient to have a way of running QEMU from the same environment, so we also define a target called `run` and provide the QEMU command-line to it. The addition of `-serial mon:stdio` in the QEMU command line means that we'll be able to issue certain QEMU monitor commands directly in the terminal, giving us a cleaner shutdown option.
